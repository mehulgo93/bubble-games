- This is our Phase-2 project
- We are making a Video Game Store in React
- The basic functionality of the webpage will be able to display all the games available from an API server and be able to click on the games for more details about the games and be able to review them and comment on them accordingly.
- Additionally, we can also add the games into cart and if the certain games are not avaiable we can show that they are out of stock.
- We can also display a search term for the searching any particular game available from the API server.
- We have to use a minimum of three different routes in our single webpage.
- We can also do the dropdown menus for the home and about and contact us if we want.
